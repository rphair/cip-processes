# #cip-processes

Shared documents containing developer suggestions on CIP process evolution: for public view, with contribution by standards stakeholders in the Cardano community.

File copies here are read-only, synced from the live copies at **https://hackmd.io/@cip-processes**
when there are significant updates: generally after meetings on the subject or online revisions.

If you have an active interest in Cardano standards via the CIP process, and want to modify & create files on the HackMD site, post on the CIP Discord channel [#cip-processes](https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/1375190972476035143).
* Higher bandwidth discussion of all these issues is also welcome on this CIP Discord channel.
* If needed, a CIP Discord invite link is on this page: [cardano-foundation/CIPs/wiki](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/wiki)
