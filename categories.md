  </li>
  <li>discussions have been held in private &amp; on Cardano Scaling
    discord already</li>
  <li>
    Ledger process issue confirmed, but not main concern</li>
  <li>mainly considering model Ethereum split into at this point: (<a
      href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206">Move ERCs to
      separate repository #7206</a>) in this discussions are held on
    forums instead of GitHub (<a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/"
      moz-do-not-send="true">Ethereum Magicians</a> &amp; <a
      href="https://ethresear.ch">Ethereum Research</a>)</li>
  <li>specific CIP &amp; CRC types could allow optimised processes for
    each... though not necessary to "split" to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Robert consideration (<a
href="https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/1375190972476035143/1381746606805880913">Discord</a>)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most important would be determining a complete taxonomy,
    highlighted by any process differences different between one part of
    that taxonomy &amp; another.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: Ledger if its own category suggested multiple
      sub-categories, each with different review / consensus processes
      (as offered here).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Mainly emphasised that no reconsideration of our originally
    conceived model of review on GitHub should ever compromise on "peer"
    review itself.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>KtorZ, mainly offering that original CIP process encompasses all
  this: if devs, architects &amp; reviewers will commit more to using it
  (<a
href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1040#issuecomment-2900043491"
    moz-do-not-send="true">GitHub</a>)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nobody can be forced to follow CIPs: so anything requiring
    "enforcement" should be elsewhere.</li>
  <li>CIPs already contain "implementation details" and "community
    standards" so we don't need another category to accommodate these.</li>
  <li>Lack of sufficient consensus has <u>not been a shortcoming of
      editors</u> since they are not providing (only checking) the
    review... <u>we need more reviewers</u> (especially "champions" for
    each category).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ryan (editor) made arguments in favour of a conservative processs (<a

  in parallel)</p>
<ul>
  <li>CIP process is already covering most demanding standards work on
    the basis of their voluntary, deliberate &amp; close participation
    (e.g. Haskell node)</li>
  <li>Teams don't have to "collaborate through the CIP process" as long
    as their agreements are eventually *defined* in it.</li>
  <li>first step: "re-define the core categories (those will require
    close collaboration between node teams)"</li>
  <li>Creating a divergent category (CRC) would be too radical a change
    to allow the necessary focus on improving existing issues.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>questions</h2>
<p>What part(s) of a potentially expanded taxonomy of CIP categories or
  types would have different review &amp; acceptance processes than the
  bulk of the others would?</p>
<p>Why did Ethereum devs think they could not keep ERCs on same
  repository as EIP's?<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Was it because they found editorial privileges irreconcilable
    between the two efforts &amp; so had to define these through GitHub
    itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>How would the quality of "peer review" be established if standards
  document were reviewed somewhere other than GitHub &amp; our
  conventional PR process?</p>
<p>How can CIP core categories be re-defined to encourage better
  participation by teams working on different nodes?<br>
