## comments
  
Josh initial presentation ([Forum issue](https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/1))

- Vital importance of a usable CIP process for standards relating to node diversity & around hard forks.
- Ethereum model presented at node diversity workshop suggested potential solution of diverging between core & application standards.
- Defined current need for community consensus in admitting possible changes to the CIP process especially to support the usability & relevance of Ledger standards.

Andre (Ledger) offered ([Forum discussion](https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/3))  

- a potential sub-categorisation of Ledger changes:
  - Large new features
  - Small tweaks
  - Glue (i.e. how does X interact with Y)
  - Security fixes
- gives some examples of how visibility & review have been different for each of these: suggesting a "decision making body" for certain changes
- \[implying a different process & likely different, Ledger-focused reviewers for some subcategories\]

"survey" of points from different presenters in [Forum issue](https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575):

- Relays feedback from Node Diversity Workshop, identifying Ethereum standards process (EIP - ERC) as a positive model.
- CIP process needs to include "streamlined" Ledger inclusion, especially for those developers who think the current GitHub process for CIPs is "hard to follow".
- Andre [suggests a Ledger sub-categorisation](https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/3) based on granularity / urgency... most of which are \*not\* appropriate to CIPs.
- CIP-0084 technically indicates all changes should be documented, but this hasn't stopped inconsistencies from happening.
- Sebastian [suggests](https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/6) (Josh agrees) the Cardano Blueprint process would work.
- Initial opinions conclude in need for "call" i.e. working group (created on Discord)

## questions

How can we encourage a higher-participation process that produces more usable standards for the ledger specification?

- ... through changes / extensions to the CIP process?
- ... though any non-CIP resources & processes (to establish in a Ledger CIP — CIP-0084 or elsewhere — but implement elsewhere)?

If, as KtorZ suggests ([here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1040#issuecomment-2900043491)) that "enforcement" is not a part of the CIP process, does that mean that any more rigorous or binding Ledger processes need to be outside the CIPs repository?
